## Settings
### Links
To add your own link to your favorite site, you just need to add a line to the HTML code, for example:

```html
<a href="https://www.github.com/">
  <i class="fab fa-github"></i>
</a>
```

### Weather
To display the weather you need to have a free API key, which can be obtained from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) website.

> If you generated a **new** API key and the weather doesn't work, then try to wait for a while until the key is activated.
